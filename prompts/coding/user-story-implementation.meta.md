# User Story Implementation Guide Prompt

## Description
Provides a comprehensive, step-by-step framework for implementing user stories with strict version control, dependency management, and quality assurance processes. Follows a structured approach with clear checkpoints and verification steps at each stage of implementation.

## Usage
1. Have a clearly defined user story with acceptance criteria
2. Have a defined Bill of Materials (BOM) with specific versions
3. Have access to the existing codebase structure
4. Use: "Please implement this user story using the implementation guidelines prompt"

## Best suited for
- Converting user stories into working code
- Projects requiring strict dependency management
- Incremental development processes
- Team environments needing consistent implementation standards
- Codebases with specific version requirements
- Projects with formal quality assurance requirements

## Output format
1. Initial context review and understanding confirmation
2. Core tools and dependencies verification
3. Structured implementation plan
4. Incremental code changes with verification points
5. Quality check confirmations
6. Progress tracking documentation
7. Definition of Done checklist completion

## Key features
