# Metadata: Implementation Prompt

## AI Assistant Compatibility
- Tested With: 
  * Aider
  * LLM: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 22, 2024 release)
- Potential Compatible Assistants: 
  * Other Claude models
  * GitHub Copilot (with modifications)

## SDLC Phase
- Phase: Implementation
- Sub-Phase: Detailed Feature Development
- Workflow: Post-Scaffolding Sprint Workflow

## Complexity Rating
- Complexity: High
- Cognitive Load: Significant
- Technical Depth: Deep code-level understanding required

## Usage Guidelines
- Prerequisite: Complete Story Analysis phase
- Requires: 
  * Story Steps Report
  * Sprint Story
  * Project Dependency Definition

## Prompt Characteristics
- Input Driven: Yes
- State Dependent: Yes
- Requires Contextual Awareness: Critical

## Best Practices
- Always verify story steps before implementation
- Maintain atomic, incremental implementation approach
- Prioritize existing project conventions
- Validate each implementation step

## Potential Challenges
- Misinterpreting story requirements
- Overlooking project-specific constraints
- Generating non-idiomatic code
- Failing to respect existing architectural patterns

## Recommended Mitigation Strategies
- Carefully review story steps before implementation
- Use implementation status commands to track progress
- Implement verification steps for each feature
- Conduct code review after AI-assisted implementation

## Version
- Current Version: 1.0.0
- Last Updated: 2024-11-09
