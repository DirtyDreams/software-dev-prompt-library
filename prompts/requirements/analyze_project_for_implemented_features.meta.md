# Implementation Status Analysis Prompt

## Description
Systematically analyzes a codebase to determine the current state of feature implementation, mapping completed, partial, and pending features against project requirements and user stories while establishing implementation priorities.

## Usage
1. Ensure required project context is available:
   - Project requirements list
   - Current user stories
   - Core technology stack information
2. Use command: "#analyze-impl" to start or resume analysis
3. Use command: "#analyze-impl-status" to check progress

## Best suited for
- Implementation progress tracking
- Sprint planning preparation
- Feature completion verification
- Technical dependency mapping
- Project status reporting
- Sprint retrospectives
- Resource allocation planning
- Milestone tracking
- Requirements validation
- Gap analysis

## Output format
- Context validation report
- Structured implementation status:
  - Completed features with evidence
  - Partially implemented features
  - Not yet implemented features
- Prioritized implementation roadmap:
  - Priority categories
  - Feature requirements mapping
  - Implementation rationale
- Progress tracking checkpoints
