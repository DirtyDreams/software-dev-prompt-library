# Getting Started with Software Development Prompts

This library contains a collection of carefully crafted prompts to support various software development workflows. Each prompt is designed to work directly with AI coding assistants.

## Using the Prompts

1. Navigate to the relevant prompt category in the `/prompts` directory
2. Share the raw URL of the prompt file with your AI assistant
3. Ask the assistant to load and integrate the prompt
4. Begin using the workflow by invoking the relevant prompt name

## Available Workflows

### Project Initialization
- Requirements generation and revision
- Technology stack selection and BOM creation
- Initial architecture design
- Project scaffolding

### Development
- Feature story generation
- Code health analysis
- System visualization with PlantUML
- Comprehensive unit testing

### Documentation
- README generation
- Code explanation and tutoring

Each workflow includes prompts that can be used independently or chained together for a complete development experience. The prompts adapt to your project's specific needs, technology choices, and development patterns.

## Prompt Structure

Each prompt has two associated files:
- `[prompt-name].md` - The actual prompt instructions
- `[prompt-name].meta.md` - Usage documentation and context

## Next Steps

1. Review the requirements for your project
2. Generate your initial tech stack using the tech stack generator
3. Design your architecture
4. Create scaffolding stories
5. Begin implementation
